A decompression bomb is a file designed to crash or render useless the program or system reading it, i.e. a denial of service. These files can be used to test whether an application is vulnerable to this type of attack.

__a note on usage__: To circumvent Github's 50MB file size upload restriction, groups of files have been zipped then bzipped. Remove these additional encodings prior to testing.

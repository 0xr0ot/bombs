### decompression bombs
A decompression bomb is a file designed to crash or render useless the program or system reading it, i.e. a denial of service. These files can be used to test whether an application is vulnerable to this type of attack.

__a note on usage__: To circumvent Github's file size upload restrictions, each size grouping for [archives](archives) and [http](http), and file format type for [images](images) have been compressed. These should be decompressed prior to using.
